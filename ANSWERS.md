## Result of analysis

Explain in a few words what you believe is actually happening based on the statistics above.

* FUNKY A: some of the frames are missing randomly 

* FUNKY B: more of the frames are missing and the delays are consistent with the missing frames

* FUNKY C: packets missing and coming out of order and packets do not arrive on 40 ms intervals

* FUNKY D: packets missing and coming out of order and packets do not arrive on 40 ms intervals

* FUNKY E:

* FUNKY F:

* FUNKY G:

* FUNKY H:
